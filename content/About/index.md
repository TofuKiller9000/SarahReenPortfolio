“I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares, as opposed to ugly things. That's my intent.” -- Saul Bass

Heyo and welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name is Sarah and I am a Programmer :laptop: and Level Designer :video_game: all wrapped up into one nerdy little ball, with a cat :cat: on the side. I enjoy reading fantasy novels & playing tabletop games, my favorite bird is the Turkey Vulture, and I pronounced "ramen" :steaming_bowl: as "ray-man" until I was 17. 

Every day I work hard to create beautiful things that bring joy, whether that be through code or pixels on the screen. I have diverse set of skills that have molded me into a flexible, self-motivating, team-player that is driven to succeed. Let's make beautiful things together! 

Check out my [Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVPah-5SR63N7SxbQ4WwmSEBoMHQBiG4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112581741077318215416&rtpof=true&sd=true) or look through my [Portfolio]({{< ref "projects" >}}) :sparkles:
